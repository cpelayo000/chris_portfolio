										<h3>A little about me</h3>
										<p>I began programming in August of 2016 and have loved every moment of it. I started out at the Los Angeles Film School under
											the Game Production Program but felt that the curriculum was a little slow. I did however take a class there on C# with Unity fundamentals,
											In which I sort of fell in love with programming. After a few months I dropped out and attended the Los Angeles Coding Dojo to further the
											little knowledge I had in the matter. During my stay at the coding bootcamp I became a proficient full-stack developer in Ruby on Rails and MEAN.</p>
										<p>I've since been tutoring kids in HTML and CSS fundamentals in addition to a couple personal projects I have going on on the side. I'm interested
											in working with anyone that I could learn from and hopefully have fun doing so as well.</p>

									<h3>Experience</h3>
									<p>While attending the Los Angeles Coding Dojo I recreated the Facebook wall in JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP. I have experience building APIs
									from the ground up in addition to pulling from already existing APIs.</p>
									<p>For about a year I worked as a teachers assistant, often writing ciriculum and organizing events.</p>
									<p>I have experience writing games such as iFighter 1945 in C# and Unity. I've also written games such as Pacman in JavaScript on browser.</p>
